# Matrix-Multiplier
A small web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alongside the Bootstrap framework. This application asks the users to enter in two matrices, and will compute the product of such matrices—if their dimensions are compatible for such an operation.

The number of rows and columns for each matrix must be specified, with the minimum dimensions being 1x1 and the maximum dimensions being 6x6. Once the dimensions are entered, the user can feel free to enter the elements of their respective matrices. Any blank entries will be handled as 0.
